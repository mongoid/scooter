Scooter [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mongoid/scooter.png?branch=master&.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mongoid/scooter)
=======

Scooter is an asynchronous (non-blocking) MongoDB driver for the JVM,
written in Scala.

Road Map
--------

This is a work in progress, with no expectations around release date
at this point. The following is where we'd like to be before release.

- Support for the same feature set as Moped with a similar API that
  is as clean as the Ruby version but Scala-esque at the same time. This
  includes support for all bson types and full replica set support with
  failover.
- Minimal dependencies, most likely only Netty.
- The fastest MongoDB driver on the JVM.
